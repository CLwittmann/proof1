      <img src="img/home/content/snowcap.jpeg" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Responsive image"><br>

      <p>Part of the “ring of fire” The Shasta Valley Hills are from a massive collapse of Mt. Shasta around 360,000 years ago. Mount Shasta is in Siskiyou County, California. The elevation of the central Shasta peak is 14,161 feet. It is the 4th highest volcano in North America and the 5th highest mountain in California. Mount Shasta has Seven USGS officially named Glaciers underground that flow through fragmented lava, creating pure springs. There are Waterfalls, Hot springs, the Cascade Range with about 20 major volcanic peaks in the High Cascades range, and that’s not counting the many little ones. </p>

      <h4>Native History</h4>
       
      <img src="img/home/content/native.jpg" class="img-fluid float-left pr-3" alt="Responsive image">
      <p class="text-wrap">  Mt. Shasta is recognized as a Native American, cultural, and cosmological property listed on the National Register of Historic Places!  It is considered to be one of the worlds oldest sacred sites. It is said that there is evidence of artifacts dating to about 11,000 years ago proving the existence of humans living there that long ago.</p>
      <p > The Shasta Indians were a group of small tribes or divisions forming the Shastan linguistic family of northern California and extending into southwestern Oregon. Their language was of the Hokan family. The Shasta called themselves “Kahosadi” or “plain speakers”.<br>The culture and customs of the Shasta were much the same, but linguistically they were divided into four groups speaking divergent dialects. These included the Shasta, Konomihu, Okwanuchu, and New River Shasta.According to local indigenous tribes, namely the Klamath people, Mount Shasta is inhabited by the spirit chief Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama, by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.[1] Writer Joaquin Miller recorded various related legends in the 1870s.</p>

          <h4>Shrouded in Mystery</h4>
      <img src="img/home/content/adama.jpg" class="img-fluid float-left pr-3" alt="Responsive image">
      <p class="text-wrap"> The mysterious figure pictured isn’t a drawing of Orlando Bloom, it's a figure associated with the myths of Mt Shasta. His name is Adama. Adama is an Ascended Master High Priest of Telos, a subterranean city that lies beneath the rocks and stones of Mt Shasta.The legend goes that Adama, while human and physical like us, is actually thousands of years old. His highly advanced body holds thoughts of only immortality and perfect health, which enable him to live thousands of years.</p>
       <p>Adama and his people arrived over 12,000 years ago right before a thermonuclear war took place on earth, devastating the surface. As a result of the hardships faced a one ground, Adama and his people decided to continue their civilization underground. Only 25,000 of the Lemurian people, the name of Adama’s race, were saved.<br>The legend continues to say that our race has seen many leaps in the 12,000 years they’ve been observing us. The surface population has been experiencing great leaps of consciousness in preparation for humanity to move through the photon belt. It is for this reason that we have begun to contact surface dwellers to make our existence known. For in order for the Earth and Humanity to continue to ascend in consciousness, the whole planet must be united and merged into ONE Light from below and ONE Light from above.</p>
